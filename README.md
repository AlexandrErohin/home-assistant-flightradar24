Flightradar24 integration allows one to track overhead flights in a given region or particular planes. It will also fire Home Assistant events when flights enter/exit/landed/took off.

<b>IMPORTANT: No need FlightRadar24 subscription!</b>

It allows you:
1. Know how many flights in your area right now, or just have entered or exited it. And get list of flights with [full information](#flight) by every relevant flight for the sensor 
2. Track a particular plane or planes no matter where it currently is, even if it is a scheduled flight
3. Get [top 10 most tracked flights on FlightRadar24](#most-tracked) 
4. Create notifications (example - [Get a notification when a flight enters or exits your area](#notification-enters), [Get a notification when a tracked scheduled flight takes off](#notification-scheduled))
5. Create automations (example - [Automatically track a flight by your needs](#automation))
6. Add flights table to your [Home Assistant dashboard](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/) by [Lovelace Card](#lovelace))
7. Track your flight as [Device Tracker](#device-tracker) 
8. Get info for last flights which were in your area or get info about latest exited flight by creating [Last Flights History Sensor](#last-flights)

## Components
### Events
 - flightradar24_entry: Fired when a flight enters the region.
 - flightradar24_exit: Fired when a flight exits the region.
 - flightradar24_most_tracked_new: Fired when a new flight appears in top 10 most tracked flights on FlightRadar24
 - flightradar24_area_landed: Fired when a flight lands in your area.
 - flightradar24_area_took_off: Fired when a flight takes off in your area.
 - flightradar24_tracked_landed: Fired when a tracked flight lands.
 - flightradar24_tracked_took_off: Fired when a tracked flight takes off.

### Sensors
 - Current in area
 - Entered area
 - Exited area
 - Additional tracked
 - Most tracked flights (You may disable it via configuration)

### <a id="device-tracker">Device Tracker</a>
You may be interested to add a live flight as device_tracker with the flight information to a person in HA.
To use it - you need to activate this feature in [Edit Configuration](#edit-configuration).
When it is enabled - this integration creates device_tracker with static name `device_tracker.flightradar24` and
this device_tracker updates when there is a live flight in the additional tracked list.
It works ONLY with one live flight from the additional tracked list at a time!

### Configuration
 - Add to track
 - Remove from track
 - API data fetching - you may disable FlightRadar API calls when not needed to prevent unnecessary API calls and save bandwidth and server load.

Sensors shows how many flights in the given area, additional tracked, just have entered or exited it. All sensors have attribute `flights` with list of [flight object](#flight) contained a full information by every relevant flight for the sensor

Configuration inputs fields allows to add or remove a flight to/from sensor - Additional tracked. Adding/Removing supports flight number, call sign, aircraft registration number

## Installation

## Uses
### <a id="notification-enters">Notification - When a flight enters or exits your area</a>
To receive notifications of the entering flights add following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Flight entry notification"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: flightradar24_entry
    action:
      service: notify.mobile_app_<device_name>
      data:
        message: >-
          Flight entry of {{ trigger.event.data.callsign }} to {{ trigger.event.data.airport_destination_city }}
          [Open FlightRadar](https://www.flightradar24.com/{{ trigger.event.data.callsign }})
        data:
          url: >-
            https://fr24.com/{{ trigger.event.data.callsign }}/{{
            trigger.event.data.id }}
          image: "{{ trigger.event.data.aircraft_photo_medium }}"
```

All available fields in `trigger.event.data` you can check [here](#flight)

If you have defined more than one device of FlightRadar24 for more places to observe - you may be interested to know what device has fired the event
It is stored in 
#### <a id="tracked_by_device">`trigger.event.data.tracked_by_device`</a>

To change name in tracked_by_device
1. Go to the <b>Settings</b>-><b>Devices & services</b>.
2. Search for `Flightradar24`, and click on it.
3. Click on three-dot near of device you wanted
4. Click on `Rename` in the opened sub-menu
5. Enter new name and click `OK`

### <a id="notification-scheduled">Notification - When a tracked scheduled flight takes off</a>
To receive notification of taking off tracked scheduled flight add following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Scheduled flight takes off"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: flightradar24_tracked_took_off
    action:
      service: notify.mobile_app_<device_name>
      data:
        message: >-
          Flight takes off {{ trigger.event.data.callsign }} to {{ trigger.event.data.airport_destination_city }}
          [Open FlightRadar](https://www.flightradar24.com/{{ trigger.event.data.callsign }})
        data:
          url: >-
            https://fr24.com/{{ trigger.event.data.callsign }}/{{
            trigger.event.data.id }}
          image: "{{ trigger.event.data.aircraft_photo_medium }}"
```

### <a id="automation">Automation</a>
To automatically add a flight to additional tracking add following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Track flights"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: flightradar24_exit
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ 'Frankfurt' == trigger.event.data.airport_origin_city }}"
    action:
      - service: text.set_value
        data:
          value: "{{ trigger.event.data.aircraft_registration }}"
        target:
          entity_id: text.flightradar24_add_to_track
```

This is an example to filter flights to track, change the conditions for your needs

### <a id="last-flights">Last Flights History Sensor</a>
You may get info for last flights which were in your area. Or get info about latest exited flight.
Here is an example for recording history for the last 5 flights.
The sensor has the same structure as `sensor.flighradar24_current_in_area` and so you can use the same markdown code.
Only the sensor state is different - it shows the latest exited flight.
You may change it for your needs.
Add following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: flightradar24_exit

    sensor:
      - unique_id: flightradar24_last_5_flights
        name: "FlightRadar24 Last 5 Flights"
        state: >-
          {% set flight = trigger.event.data %}
          {{ flight.flight_number }} - {{ flight.airline_short }} - {{ flight.aircraft_model }} ({{ flight.aircraft_registration }})
          {{ flight.airport_origin_city }} > {{ flight.airport_destination_city }}
        attributes:
          flights: >-
            {% set n = 5 %}
            {% set m = this.attributes.flights | count | default(0) %}
            {{ [ trigger.event.data ] + 
               ( [] if m == 0 else 
                 this.attributes.flights[0:n-1] )
            }}
          icon: mdi:airplane
```
